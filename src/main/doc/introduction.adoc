= Karaf Camel Log QuickStart

This quickstart shows a simple Apache Camel application that logs a message to the server log every second.

This example is implemented using solely the XML DSL (there is no Java code). The source code is provided in the following XML file `src/main/resources/OSGI-INF/blueprint/camel-log.xml`.
It also shows how Karaf assembly files can be overridden using resources from `src/main/resources/assembly/`. The included sample log file `etc/org.ops4j.pax.logging.cfg` sets the log level to DEBUG.
